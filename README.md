# SampleKeepNote
Small sample application for adding notes. Front end app is developed on Angular 5, .Net core in Middle-ware and SQL &amp; Mongo used for database.


### Assignment Step Description

In this case study Keep Note Step 6, we will implement JWT (JSON Web Token) on top of Keep Note Step Assignment. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is
digitally signed.

In this application, technologies are Angular, .Net core Web API's, SQL server, Mongo
