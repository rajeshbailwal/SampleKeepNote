### Assignment Step Description

In this case study Keep Note Step 6, we will implement JWT (JSON Web Token) on top of Keep Note Step 5 Assignment. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that 
defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is
digitally signed.

In this step, we will create this application in five parts 
    
        1. AuthenticationService
        2. UserService
        3. NoteService
        4. CategoryService
        5. ReminderService


### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder on your local machine.
    Step 2: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for AuthenticationService and run the test cases.
    Step 3: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for UserService and run the test cases.
    Step 4: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for NoteService  and run the test cases.
    Step 5: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for CategoryService and run the test cases.
    Step 6: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for ReminderService and run the test cases.

#### Use this as a boilerplate for your new project.
